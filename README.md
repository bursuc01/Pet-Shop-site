The site offers such supplies: leashes, cat and dog food, collars, toys, and many other things, a login/register functionality, so that the user can view the prices available on the site for the available products but that he/she cannot use the site for ordering the products nor selecting them for the shopping cart unless he/she creates an account. The selected products will be added to the to the shopping cart available in the top right corner of the site, where he can view a list every item he wants to purchase, quantity and final price.
- There is an information rubric for users that have where you will be able to ask questions about common curiosities about pets, questions that are categorized by the animals themselves. The main categories are: dogs, cats, reptiles, fish, birds, and others.
- In order to manage the site there will be an administrator account that can add, remove and modify offers on the site so that the site it is up to date with it's stock and changing prices. Every time a user will select a product, it's quantity will be updated, and if he/she changes his/her mind about the product, the quantity will update again to the value it was before the order placement.
